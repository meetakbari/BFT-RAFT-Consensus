# BFT-RAFT-Consensus
Implemented a prototype of voting-based consensus algorithm for permissioned Blockchain named BFT-RAFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerant RAFT) using PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance)’s Byzantine Fault Tolerant design into RAFT to tolerate both Crash and Byzantine faults in a single consensus protocol while still maintaining RAFT’s understandability and higher scalability.
